# AOC 2024

This time I'll surely not drop it on day 2.

## Wall of shame

Problems I had to resort to using an LLM to resolve in a reasonable amount of time.

- Day5, part2: Claude pointed out I can toposort to figure out the right order of pages...
- Day6, part2: Claude helped me find a bug in my loop-iness checking code.
- Day7: Claude had to remind me how to generate permutations without recursion.
